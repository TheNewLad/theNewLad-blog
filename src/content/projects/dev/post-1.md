This website is my first real project now that the AstroJS training wheels have been taken off. I am adapting a template I found to allow me to quickly get my personal site up and running without having to worry about the design. I am also using DaisyUI to make the site look good without having to write a lot of CSS. I am excited to see how this project turns out. I hope you like it.
