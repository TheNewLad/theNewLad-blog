title: My First Blog Post
---

Thank you for stopping by. I will keep this post short because I don't know what to say. It's like when you get a new tool and want to use it but don't know how or what to do with it. That's how I feel right now.

I made this site to show off what I'm doing to improve my life as a person and developer. You can expect to see a little insight into my brain.

I write how I think, so excuse the mess of words, lol. I don't want to overthink writing this because if I do, this blog will never get published. I'll figure it out along the way, and this will serve as a snapshot of that journey.

Again, thanks for reading this if you made it this far. And until next time. Take care!
